## overview
- Amazon s3 is one of the main builfing blocks of aws
- back up an sotrage for file and disk
- infinitely scalable
- disaster recovery
- archivin
- hybrid cloduo storage
- host applications
- media hostign
- data laes and big data analytibs
- software udates
- staic websites

## s3 buckets
- Amazon s3 allows people to stoer objects fiels in buckets directrotr
- bucket names are unique globally
- buckets are defined at the region level
- s3 look slike a global service but buckets are created in a region
- naming convention no upppercase no underscore no ip and cannot be look into this more

## objects
- objects are files they have a key
- the key is the full path of the objectlike s3.lalal/lalal.tct
- prefic anf then the object namrme
- there is no concept of directoresd
- valuse are the contenet of the body
- mac objext size is 5tb
- bigger than 5gb multup uploaf

## amazon s3 security
- user based whwich api calls shoudl be allowed fro a specific user
- resoure based bucket polices wide rules from the s3 buvkets console allows crocc acccoutnt
- object access control list finer grain can be disabled
- bucket access control list less commin
- i am principle acrees s3 bucket ther user iam permissions allow it or the resourse polciy allows it and there is no explcit deny
- ecryption the object using key

## s3 replication
- must enable versionon in the source and destination buvkets
- crr the regions must be different
- srrr the regions will be different hence the name
- buckts in different aws accounts
- copuing is async
- must have iam persmsions to the s3
- crr use casses compliance lower latency prelication across account
- see log aggression live replication betwen prodiction and tes acccount
- after you enable only new onbjest will be replicates
- if you want to replicate old objesxt you can use s3 batch replication relicated exisisitng objexts that failed replication
- you can replicate delete markers from source to target 
- deletion with the verison id nor replicated to avoud malic dlete
- no chaining of replation

## sotrage classes
- standard
- infrequent accesss
- one zone infrequent acess
- glacier instand retrival
- glacier flexiabable retrval
- deep archive
- intelliget tiering

## durability and availability
- durability represent how many timea an object will be lost
- high durability 99.9999999999 of objects across multuole az
- if you store 10m onjexts on s3 you can expext to loose a single objext over 10,000 years
- same for all storage type
- availability is the liklyhood that a service is
- how long the service is availabe in the year

## life cycle rule
- automate the transition of your onjects between different storage classxes
- tansitions actions: confiugre onjects to transisitiion to another sotarge class
- move to stand iaclass after 60 days of creationg
- expiration actions
- can be used to delete old version of files if versioning is enabled
- can be used to delete incolplete multi part uplooad
- specif prefix or path and tags

## requester pay
- in general bucket owner pays for all the amazon s3 storage and data transdeer costs associated with thier bucke
- Networking cost is also build to the owner
- requester pay bucksts allow you to sharge the requester
- the reuedter must not be anynon

## event notificatio
- created removed respor repliucation fileter events
- react to event in the s3
- create a notification that can send to sqs sns or lambbs
- create asy many events
- second
- sns resouse acces plolicy will alow the s3 bucket to communicate to the sns oe the sqs que also for the lambda funciton

## event bridgee
- all s3 bucket events will get sent over to the amazon evenet bridge
- you can set rules to over 18 servies as desticnation
- advamced fileter options with json rules
- archive replay evevnts step ductions kinesis streams firehosu

## s3 select and glacier select
- retrive less data using sql by performing server side filtering
- can filter by row and column
- less netowrk transfer
- servide side filtering

## modify objext metdata and properites
- you can modify the metdata and properties og mnay onbjext at once
- envoke functions
- encrypt
- restore
- a job consists of a list of objects the action to perform and the optioanl params
- there are retires progress
- s3 inventoryu to filter onjesxt
- inventoryu sleect then batch

## storage lens
- understand and anaylize sotrage across the entire aws org
- dachboard
- ecport metircs daily to an s3 bucket
- defult dachnoard for free and adcance metrics for multu region sna dmulti account
- cant be deleted byt can be disabled
- summaty metrics gneeral insiglts aobut the s3
- cost optimixation metrics non curent verison sotrage bits
