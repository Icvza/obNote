# Kinesis data streams

#### Overview: a way to stream big data in your systems

- Each stream is mad up of multiple [[1717962785-CCEI|shards]]
- Shards are number of sequencially numbered data records 1 - n
- This is something that you have to provision ahead of time you well say hey i need 6 shards
- the data will be split between all the shards
- Your chards will define your stream capacity interms of ingestion
- [[1717963107-KURV|producers]] will send data to the stream
- the [[producers]] will generate a [[1717963287-QFYQ|record]]
- once the data is kinesis data streams it can be consumed by many [[1717963584-YVBC|consumers]]
- retention can be set to 1 day to 365 days
- Ability to reprocess replay data
- once data is inserted in kinesis it can't be deleted immautability
- Data that shares the same partition goes to the same shard
- Managed aws lambda kinesis data firehose kinesis data anayltics

Capacity modes:

1- Provisioned mod

- you chose the number of shars provisioned scale manually or using api
- each shard gets 1mb or 1000 records per second
- each shard gets 2mb out classic or enchanced fan out consumers
- you pay per shard provisioned per hour

2-On demand mode

- no need to provision or manage the Capacity
- Default capacity provisioned 4mbs in or 4000 records per second
- scales automatically bsed on observed throughput peak during last 30 days
- pay per stream per hour & date in / oout

Security:

- Control access authorization using iam policies
- Encyption in flight using HTTPS endpoints-
- encyption at rest using KMS
- you can implement encryption/decyption of data on client side
- vpc endpoints available for kinesis to access within vpc
- Monitor API calss using cloudtrail
