#### Overview
- Lustre is a type of parallel distribtes file system for large scale computing 
- the name lustre is derived from "linux and cluster"
- Machine learning High-performance computing HPC is a keyword that you should know. When asked about HPC you should assosiate HPC with luster
- Video proccesing Finacial modeling electonic desgin automantion 
- Scales up to 100gbs millions of iops sub ms lateencies 

#### Storage options 
- SSD low latency IOPS intensive workloads small and random file operations 
- HDD Throughput intensive workloads large and sequentical file operations 

##### Seamless integration with s3 
- can read s3 as a file system thorugh FSx
- can write the output of the computations back to s3 through FSx
- Can be  used from on premises servers through vpn or direct connect
